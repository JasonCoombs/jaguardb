## JaguarDB is NoSQL IoT Database ##

**IoT Data**

JaguarDB is highly scalable, fast NoSQL database for Internet of Things (IoT) which handles large volumes of
location data and time series data, unifying events data consisting of space and time.

**Instant Scaling**

In traditional way of horizontal scaling of distributed database systems, data migration is required and may
take a `LONG time`, referred as scaling nightmare. JaguarDB does not require any data migration and 
scaling to hundreds or thousands nodes
can be achieved `INSTANTLY` which may take only a few seconds.

**Location Data**

JaguarDB is the only database that supports both vector and raster spatial data.
Vector spatial shapes include line, square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, sphere, ellipsoid, cone,
cylinder, box, 3D line, 3D square, 3D rectangle, 3D circle, 3D ellipse, and 3D triangle.

Raster spatial shapes include point, multipoint, linestring, multilinestring, polygon, multipolgon, 
and their 3D counterparts. 

Other databases support only one tag at a location, while JaguarDB supports unlimited tags at a location.
This can be useful for analyzing complex location-based data and metrics.

**Time Series Data**

JaguarDB enables fast ingestion of time series data, coupling location-based data. It also can index in both dimensions, 
space and time. Back-filling time series data is also fast (inserting large volumes of data in past time).
