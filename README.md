JaguarDB -- NoSQL IoT Database

JaguarDB is an open source, highly scalable, fast NoSQL database for location and time data.
During horizontal scaling, zero data migration is needed, resolving a big challenge in database scaling.
JaguarDB is the only powerful database that supports both vector and raster spatial data.
Vector spatial shapes include line, square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, sphere, ellipsoid, cone,
cylinder, box, 3D line, 3D square, 3D rectangle, 3D circle, 3D ellipse, and 3D triangle.
Raster spatial shapes include point, multipoint, linestring, multilinestring, polygon, multipolgon, 
and their 3D counterparts.
