This example will illustrate how to load data to Zeppelin from Jaguar database,
and display graphs in Zeppelin.

1. Start Jaguar servers on all hosts.
   
   $ cd $HOME/jaguar/bin
   $ ./jaguarstart_on_all_hosts.sh

   After a few seconds, you can login to Jaguar server and create a table.
   $ ./jag -u admin -p jaguar -d test -h 192.168.7.120:5555

   User name, password, IP address, port number and database name may vary 
   depending on your own case.

2. Create a table named "pricetable" in Jaguar and insert some data.
   
   jaguar> create table pricetable ( key: year int, value: price tinyint);
   jaguar> insert into pricetable values(2000, 10);
   jaguar> insert into pricetable values(2005, 15);
   jaguar> insert into pricetable values(2010, 20);
   jaguar> insert into pricetable values(2015, 25);

   The table uses "year" as primary key and "price" as value.

3. Start Zeppelin server process on current host (Zeppelin host).

   $ cd $HOME/jaguarzeppelin/bin
   $ ./zeppelin-daemon.sh start
   
   Now Zeppelin has started. We can then open a browser to plot a graph.

4. Change user name and password of jaguar interpreter on Zeppelin.
   (1) Open an Internet browser.
   (2) Enter Zeppelin host IP:8080 in address bar.
       For example, 192.168.7.120:8080. 192.168.7.120 is the IP address of
       the Zeppelin host.
   (3) Click on "anonymous" in the top-right corner in your browser. 
       And then click on "Interpreter".
   (4) Find "jaguar" interpreter, and click on "edit".
       Change default.user and default.password to your own user name and 
       password that are used to login to Jaguar database.
   (5) Click on "Save".

5. Database name in jaguar interpreter on Zeppelin.
   If you check default.url in jaguar interpreter on Zeppelin, it may be like
   jdbc:jaguar://192.168.7.120:5555/test. Here, 'test' is the default database name
   of Jaguar which Zeppelin will connect to. It should be changed to the database
   you actually want to connect to.

6. Plot a graph.
   (1) Click on Notebook at the very top of the web page. 
       And then click on "Create new note". 
       Give a note name, such as "Plot Jaguar Data"
       Change Default Interpreter to "jaguar".
       Click on "create note".
   (2) On the new web page, type the following command in the input box:
       select * from pricetable order by year
       And then press Shift+Enter.
       A table including all data records in pricetable will show up. 
       You can click on the different graph buttons to display the data with
       different chart styles, such as Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Area Chart, Line Chart 
       or Scatter Chart. 

7. Stop Zeppelin.
   If you want to stop Zeppelin server on current host, you can execute the following
   commands.

   $ cd $HOME/jaguarzeppelin/bin
   $ ./zeppelin-daemon.sh stop
